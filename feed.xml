The following is about the nature of beauty in art, and personal beauty in representational paintings specifically.</p>

<h4 id="the-nature-of-beauty-in-art">The Nature of Beauty in Art</h4>

<p>A work of art is an artifact of a kind created, with artistic intention and upon presentation to be attributed artistic value by an authoriative entity on the matter of arthood, or so I claim [1]. This definition does not contradict that there could be a more essentialist mechanism, but respects the possibility that there is an essential uncertainty in what constitutes art.</p>

<p>Art is part of a sociocultural system, thus there is no definition independant of the public that is part of it. The authority, on a societal level, are the people or institutions ascribed the role of arbiter by the system, like museums, art critics and the media, or on a smaller scale a person respected for their judgments of taste within a social circle. As a consequence, while the taste in art may be highly subjective, in theory not all judgements of taste have the same validity. Kant argues that a genuine judgment of taste ought to be disinterested, not rely on subjective idiosyncrasies even including human desires, in which case it reaches a state of objective validity. Kant’s criterion to reach an objective judgement does not contradict David Hume’s criterion of value in art, the ‘test of time’ from his 1757 essay, ‘Of the Standard of Taste’, or idea of a proposed class of critics that are able to find objective beauty. In practice problems arise, because disinterestedness is not extrinsically observable and there is little incentive to honor sentiments contradicting one’s own if there is little at stake as in the mundane valuation of art [2].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But where there is such a diversity in the internal frame or external situation as is entirely blameless on both sides, and leaves no room to give one the preference above the other; in that case a certain degree of diversity in judgment is unavoidable, and we seek in vain for a standard, by which we can reconcile the contrary sentiments.” — ‘Of the Standard of Taste’ by David Hume [3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With artistic value, we define an umbrella term for all values the artifact can possibly exibit, that aid its acceptance by the artworld authority as art. As identified in previous posts, a pluralistic conception of artistic value is required to better understand the appeal of artworks [4]. Art might reward a person’s contemplation of its aesthetic properties like beauty or harmony as pleasurable fulfulment of a need, or it might offer alternative perspectives and sentimental value via the subjective cognition of the art-object.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> For example, in traditional Western painting primarily concerned with representational modes of production, it can be agreed upon that arranging for an artwork to be perceived as beautiful can make for a meaningful contribution to the artistic value qua aesthetic value contributed; injected into the relation between work and onlooker.</p>

<p>Kant, in his 1790 work “Critique of Judgment”, identifies free and dependent (also named adherent, conditioned) beauty, whereby representational painting and human beauty are mostly defined by their dependent beauty characteristics. With the claim to subjective universality via a judgement of taste, dependent beauty is defined by its evaluation that presupposes a concept of the thing under examination, thus an idea of what it is supposed to be [4], [5]. Under this premise, it fulfills its function and we can conclude that “The beauty of representational paintings arises when a painting is beautiful as a representation of something.” [4]. The contribution to artistic value from dependent beauty is thus further spread between appearance properties of what is shown, i.e. a landscape, a cityscape, or person, and the presentation itself; the latter is influenced by the onlooker’s appreciation for the quality of craftsmanship, composition, rendition, and the surroundings of the art-object.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>In recent decades, much pointed to an emerging field of research to explain what may guide the ideals of beauty [5], [4]. In the 1980s, at the peak of the cognitive revolution pioneered by thinkers like Noam Chomsky, there emerged the view that rather than regarding the mind as a blank slate to be inscribed with cultural values, it is regarded to mechanistically function as information processor with innate values for interests and tastes initialized via evolutionary processes like natural selection [6]. Evolutionary psychology combines evolutionary theory with cognitive psychology and claims authority in questions of personal aesthetic preferences, seemingly legitimized by natural science. In my opinion, evolutionary psychology has been used as a tool by bigots to justify social unequalities and the status quo, because this almost pseudo-scientific field is inviting to just-so stories in which the argument is only based on its internal plausability and rought ideas about prehistoric humans, hence can be argued eather way to further one’s point of view. Evolutionary biology shows that adaptation is just one part in evolutionary variation occurance next to mutation, recombination, and genetic drift, wherein natural selection does not need to play a role in developing mundane features [7]. Whereas the explaination of the quantitive research results via evolutionary theory might not be falsifiable, the findings can be applied to a certain extent, so let us narrow the focus and consider a realistic portrait painting with its rigid convention of form, wherein dependent beauty will be dictated by the personal beauty of the individual representend to a large degree. Various studies attempt to find general preferences in human biological traits like degree of averageness, symmetry, sexual dimorphism, ocular topography, or neoteny by considering participants responses, to evaluate beauty and make physiognomic deductions.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> But coming back to Hume, these are all sentiments, not judgments, as their subjectivity is not accounted for and there is not really a way to remove this noise floor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Vainly would we […] endeavour to enter into the sentiments of others, and divest ourselves of those propensities which are natural to us.” — ‘Of the Standard of Taste’ by David Hume [3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no reason to believe that the mean of sentiments can lay claim to lasting, objective truth. Agreeable predictions can be made for a general population, so not all is misguided about evolutionary psychology and quantitive research looking to yield general trends in preferences of physical attractiveness, but they certainly cannot claim the fidelity required to reasonably dictate the understanding of personal beauty in representational portrait painting, or the practice of creating the aforementioned.</p>

<p>The attempt to quantify beauty in the above manner is unsatisfactory because it reduces beauty to its givenness and utility, it reduces the distance between the narcissistic ego and the other through its self-centered attempt to understand and find value in its consumption [8]. True beauty in art is a resistance to the erosion of otherness. In “Agonie des Eros”, Byung-Chul Han identifies that one cannot love the other who has been deprived of otherness, but only consume it. As Eros [and beauty] are a relation to the other that is placed beyond abilities of reason and the faculties of mind, it follows that if one could possess, please and recognize the other, it would not be the other. Possessing, recognizing, grasping are synonyms of the aforementioned abilities [9].</p>

<h4 id="painting-as-a-free-time-activity">Painting as a Free Time Activity</h4>

<p>At the turn of the 20th century, conditions for workers improved and the concept of “free time” extended from the wealthy few of the leisure class to the regular workers [10]. Adorno points out that genuine freedom does not have to follow from having free time, because of what occupational labour demands of us, we are subconsiously forced to alter what we do with our free time, caused by exhaustion and atrophy of creativity (thats why amateurs create superfluous paintings, as he claims). People resort to hobbies, “a pursuit outside one’s regular occupation engaged in especially for relaxation” to cope, which is an unfree use of free time, as it becomes an extension of work or adaptation to work in that case.</p>

<p>While work increases the objective value in the world and is thus exchangeable, a genuinely free leisure time activity is indifferent to that and is intended to create value for the actor and not others, be it society, the employer or the leisure industry. This does not mean that no objective value can be created in the process, or even an absence of activity and work, as there is such a thing as “working by way of leisure” [11]. But Adorno does not consider that people have to work, so an unproductive, “mindless” use of free time to aid their work may be required. Being free from the hobby ideology is a priviledge; you can only be free and be “working by way of leisure”, if your energy is not bound by your labour. And you can only reflect on your lag of freedom via your use of free time, when you have the time and freedom to do so, thus many people will not even realize that they are caught up in this pattern.</p>

<p>It is also not clear how to determine what a truly free activity is, because even sport is put into question by Adorno, as “The accepted reason for playing sport is that it makes believe that fitness itself is the sole, independent end of sport: whereas fitness for work is certainly one of the covert ends of sport.” [12]. For the act of painting, the question becomes at what point the painting is product of hobby activity and when of work by way of leisure; which is ultimately a question about its quality and objective (intersubjective) value, a rather futile endeavour. Regardless of whether that condition is met, I personally do not consider painting merely a hobby, since I have invest nontrivial amounts of time, both the free and should-have-been-spend-on-other-things kind and it, at times, just feels too much like working.</p>

<p>For the first time, I also build a custom frame to match the painting.</p>

<h4 id="framing-and-displaying-paintings">Framing and Displaying Paintings</h4>

<p>Frames can possess more than mere utility; beyond protecting works from environmental factors, they exhibit and enhance artistic value of the Gesamtkunstwerk [total work of art] [13]. Of particular interest in this regard is the Artist frame, created or designated for a specific painting by that painter. Depending on the type of frame envisioned for the work, the artisan craft of framemaking will require experience and access to adequate woodworking and specialty equipment. The carving of specific moldings from strips of wood, cutting glass, gilding, and application of composition ornamentation (compo) may be unfeasible without a workshop equipped for these tasks and a certain throughput of frames to justify the purchase of all the bulk materials.</p>

<p>Regardless of who made the frame, in order to prevent damage while achieving the aforementioned benefits, risks associated with framing and displaying paintings must be mitigated by follwing established conservation best practices.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Although picture framing glass is not normally used to protect oil paintings, it can be beneficial to their long-term conservation if careful consideration is given to the change in air and temperature conditions the work experiences. Outer frames with a matching wooden mat, perhaps linen-covered, as a spacer between the painting and the glass are an unusual but attractive display option.</p>

<h4 id="minor-colorimetry-update">Minor Colorimetry Update</h4>

<p>We previously discussed a method to generate a spectral power distribution (<span class="smallcaps">Spd</span>) for a given sRGB value [16]. I since came up with a new conversion method that uses an artificial neural network, trained on a public dataset [17], to find the <span class="smallcaps">Spd</span>. The average valuation loss in terms of root mean squared error is $2.645\times10^{-2}$, but I am sure it could be improved with further hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p>The plots visualize the available dataset in RGB color space.

Thus, the model accuracy for those values is not relevant for this application. For comparison, we can roughly see the colors present in this painting.</p>

This post contains a continuation of colorimetry basics, introduced in the last post. The new painting is ekphrastically filigreed, and techniques for its production are explained.</p>

<h4 id="colorimetry">Colorimetry</h4>

<p>While the introduction to colorimetry by example of an approximation method for spectral reflectance curve generation from sRGB values brought us closer to the goal of calculating mixing ratios of paints for a given color, even less than $0.1 \%$ of pigment weight variation within a mixture can have a visually substantial impact in my experience.
In this application a high level of precision is required, one that the previously presented spectral matching method does not offer, especially once we consider that the result has to improve one’s ability beyond what can be achieved by traditional practice of mixing.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>If we partition the visible range, limited by the narrowest spectral bandwidth that presents a noticeable difference in hue, experiments show that the needed threshold can be as low as 1nm around 500nm and 600nm, meaning a radiation’s wavelength shift of 1nm would result in detectable chromatic differences.[1] Thus, for oil-colorant formulation we need to consider a method to subtractively mix optically thick turpid media with suspended non-luminous light scattering pigment particles; the current state of the art for this setting is the two-flux Saunderson-Kubelka-Munk Model.[2]</p>

<p>The paint is based on a translucent medium, usually linseed oil or safflower oil, which is rendered optically thick by inhomogeneously dispended, colored pigment particles of a size about one order of magnitude larger than the visible wavelengths; consequently all incident light will be Mie-scattered over multiple wavelength-dependent diffusion and absorption events, and completely diffuse along the direction of the incident light ray so that only considering the ascending flux of reflection $\Phi_{\uparrow i, \lambda}(s)$ suffices.</p>

</center>
<p>The two-flux Kubelka-Munk mixing law describes the spectral reflectance $R_{i,\infty}(\lambda)$ at the surface $s=0$ as the ratio of fluxes, and by assigning each internal turpid layer-element $ds$ that the light moves through a probability of photon absorption $K(\lambda)$ and photon scattering $S(\lambda)$ that are characteristic of the wavelength and pigment mixture encountered<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, as long as the ray does not reach the substrate, i.e. the canvas, as a function of those two coefficients for each pigment type.</p>

\[R_i(\lambda) = \frac{\Phi_{\uparrow i, \lambda}(s=0)}{\Phi_{\downarrow i, \lambda}(s=0)}\]

\[\frac{K(\lambda)}{S(\lambda)} = \frac{(1-R_{i,\infty}(\lambda))^2}{2 R_{i,\infty}(\lambda)}\]

\[\frac{K_{mix}(\lambda)}{S_{mix}(\lambda)} = \frac{\sum_j c_j K_j(\lambda)}{\sum_j c_j S_j(\lambda)}\]

<p>With addition of Saunderson’s Equation (including specular reflection component), $R_{i,\infty}(\lambda)$ equates to a function of reflectance measurements $R’(\lambda)$, while also considering light source specific Fresnel reflection at the air-paint border $\rho_0(\lambda) \approx \frac{(n(\lambda)-1)^2}{(n(\lambda)+1)^2}$ and internally $\rho_i(\lambda) \approx 0.68\cdot n -0.56$, where $n$ refers to the refractive index.</p>

\[R_{i,\infty}(\lambda) = \frac{R'(\lambda)-\rho_0(\lambda)}{(1-\rho_0(\lambda))(1-\rho_i(\lambda))+\rho_i(\lambda)R'(\lambda)-\rho_0(\lambda)\rho_i(\lambda)}\]

<p>Starting from reflectance measurements $R’(\lambda)$, we are able to calculate possible mixtures of pigments with hitherto unknown concentrations $c_j$, that can match a target spectral reflectance by characterizing each pigment’s $K_j(\lambda)$ and $S_j(\lambda)$ coefficients, leaving the mixing law equations to be solved for $c_j$ only.</p>

<p>Characterization is initialized by finding the four unknown coefficients of two pigments, usually black and white, by assigning $S_W = 1$, and finding the rest via spectral reflectance measurements of three compositions; masstone white (W), masstone black (K), and a mixture (KW) where $c_K=3\%$ and $c_W=97\%$.</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
S_W =&amp; 1\\
K_W =&amp; \frac{M_W}{S_W}\\
K_K =&amp; - \frac{c_W(M_W - M_{KW})}{(1-c_W)(M_K-M_{KW})}M_K\\
S_K =&amp; \frac{K_K}{M_K}
\end{aligned}\]

<p>For each additional pigment (C), two more measurements are required; either a mixture (CW) where $c_{CW}=5\%$ and $c_W=95\%$ for organic pigments, or a mixture (CW) where $c_{CW}=25\%$ and $c_W=75\%$ for inorganic pigments, and a second mixture (CK) where $c_{CK}=99\%$ and $c_K=1\%$.</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
S_C =&amp; \left\{ \frac{(1-c_{CK})[M_{CK}S_K-K_K]}{c_{CK}} - \frac{(1-c_{CW})[M_{CW}S_W-K_W]}{c_{CW}} \right\} \frac{1}{M_{CW}-M_{CK}}     \\
K_C =&amp; \left\{ \frac{(1-c_{CK})[M_{CK}S_K-K_K]}{c_{CK}M_{CK}} - \frac{(1-c_{CW})[M_{CW}S_W-K_W]}{c_{CW}M_{CW}} \right\} \frac{1}{1/M_{CW}- 1/M_{CK}}    
\end{aligned}\]

\[M_{X} = \frac{(1-R_{i,\infty, X}(\lambda))^2}{2 R_{i,\infty, X}(\lambda)}\text{ where } X\in \{K, W, KW, CK, CW\}\]

<p>By using the obtained absorption and scattering coefficients for reflectance matching, we find the best physically fitting combinations of pigments that can be further evaluated and optimized with colorimetric methods, like metameric matching and color difference specifications.</p>

<p>If the below equation is satisfied, which is rarely the case, an exact solution was found. In other cases, the solution is evaluated by calculating the spectral reflectance from the results and comparison to the target by finding the root mean square (<span class="smallcaps">Rms</span>).[1]</p>

\[\sum_{i=1}^{n\text{ pigments}} c_i \left[ K_i(\lambda_j)-S_i(\lambda_j)\frac{K_{mix}(\lambda_j)}{S_{mix}(\lambda_j)}\right]
= \sum_{i=1}^{n\text{ pigments}} c_i Q_i(\lambda_j) = 0\]

<p>Not only is finding an exact solution unlikely, we also still need the reference reflectance data, that for example belongs to an sRGB value, and the illuminant present, to optimize the found mixture of pigments.</p>

<h4 id="techne">Techne</h4>

<p>Goethe said “You can only see what you know.” [“Man sieht nur, was man weiß.”], thusly a painting’s perception can change with additional information and artwork is never completely seperable from its creator.
A descriptive work of poetry that relates to an artwork through rhetorical devices will not be able to replace, but may be able to enhance the painting by adding information and context.
The poem “Edward Hopper and the House by the Railroad (1925)” by Edward Hirsch [3] about the eponymous painting is a good example for this so called ekphrastic poetry, a common practice since the greek antiquity.
Playing with language to draft poetry is enjoyable, finding the right words almost feels like solving cross-word puzzles, but it does require a lot of courage to share amateurish attempts, thus offering a slightly more prosaic examination of this post’s painting ex infra will have to suffice.</p>

<p>In juxtaposition to Hirsch’s stanzas and Bildakt theory, by considering the interaction between beholder, painter and painted object/subject, this work too could be said to deal with the gaze, looking and being looked at.
Under this premise, one can read into the painted figure, a sense of frustration for it is instrumentalized to serve, and be evaluated by, the gaze of both painter and beholder. At the same time, as a passive object, the painting has no agency.
In an evenly lit white void as if placed in a display window, forced to be beheld by onlookers to be only one among thousands of impressions, to satisfy the compulsive act of sedating the mind with an all-too-fleeting distraction.
Art-objects as pseudo-subjects are acted-upon, suffer from a strong power asymmetry defined by the artistic and aesthetic conventions of objectification, this applies to figurative painting depictions in particular.</p>

<p>Because the paintings have little impasto, they are suitable to be scanned by a regular document scanner. The harsh, direct lighting offered by these scanners is the biggest downside compared to a daylight photograph; this makes the scans unusable for display purposes, but allows for a very detailed mapping of the painting.
There is no lens distortion, or changes in lighting condition, and a 1200dpi scan at $30\times40cm$ result in a resolution of 268 megapixels.
Parameters derived from a scanned color checker card can be reused indefinitely, making scans comparable over time.</p>

<p>On a side note, an oil painting is traditionally comprised of multiple layers of paint.
The opacity of paints is too low, and even the lightest brush’s brushmarks too deep, to achieve the desired palette mixture’s masstone with just one coating of the ground, naturally I was looking for a good method to preserve the mixed colors, for reuse and unoxidized reference at a later stage. Oil paint aging happens because of oxidative polymerization, creating a molecule network, and oxidative degradation, which forms unlinked molecules. After this first stage, hydrolysis follows in both cases which can make the paint vulnerable to extraction of those smaller molecules by solvents, depending on the amount of degradation it experienced. [4] That is to say, there is no aging without oxidization, an environment which can be created in an airtight container with oxygen scavenger sachets, made of a mixture of iron powder and sodium chlorite.</p>

<p>The plan is to store mixtures in tiny zip lock bags and store those in an air-tight container with an oxygen remover, in the expectation that the paints will remain unchanged. When I tried this preservation method over a period of about a month, there was some stiffening of the paint, but that should already be enough time for the underlying layer of paint to dry enough to paint another one. It is not perfect, but to quote Nam June Paik, „When too perfect lieber Gott Böse“.</p>

This post attempts an axiological discussion of area studies, second language acquisition and the interdependence of these prima facie disjoined subject areas.</p>

<p>By introducing this topic, I am expanding the established network of thought presented on this website, to further interlink seemingly independent subject areas, as this often leads to innovative ideas.</p>

<h4 id="the-case-for-area-studies">The Case for Area Studies</h4>

<p>A promising way to link previous considerations of art and sports to area studies is to look at their common evaluative aspect. Axiology connects aesthetics with area studies via ethics when introducing area studies via Rawls’ Theory of Justice.
Ethics addresses questions of morality, which in turn assigns a value to human behavior. This assignment is according to moral values and norms that are, as I propose defying normative ethic’s contestations, culturally and temporally relative; defined by a group, society or culture. Good moral character is considered most beneficial to society.</p>

<p>Rawls states that “character can be molded by antecedent circumstances” and people “acquire a desire to act justly, and to do so for the right reasons, when they have lived under and benefited from just institutions”.[1] A just society causes its constituting citizens to flourish, it induces existential meaning and an interest to act morally; in that sense character is subject to moral luck. A trait that helps to propel this feedback mechanism is a virtue, such as participating in the civil public’s deliberations to weigh interests not your own. Area studies offer a pure form to exercise this virtue and add to a moral character and just society via the taken civic responsibility. By the holistic engagement with other cultures and societies within the global landscape one creates and fosters a set of virtues for a transareal citizen.[2]</p>

<p>Area studies as a discipline has been criticized for being too specific and detailed without scientific concept building or generalizing; merely telling stories by accidentally stumbling into the examined regions’ otherness. This putative weakness, a researcher in “Rebirth of Area Studies” argues, is a strength since “the fact that we not only study ‘otherness’ but often find ourselves through our travels and our readings in foreign languages to be an ‘other’”.[3] As I hypothesized above, this engagement could be conducive to good character development; second language acquisition in particular is known to increase “tolerance of ambiguity”.[4]</p>

<h4 id="second-language-acquisition">Second Language Acquisition</h4>

<p>Communication by language is a form of information transmission used to transfer thoughts. Speech norms are thus a necessary condition for cultural exchange. The so called Sapir–Whorf hypothesis further states, that at least linguistic relativity is a given and influences of language feed back into thought creation, hence second language acquisition (<span class="smallcaps">Sla</span>) is a necessary condition for fully understanding a foreign culture with a distinct language.</p>

<p>Linguistic theories about language learnability and acquisition can be divided based on their stance regarding linguistic nativism. Neurobiologically minded approaches conclude that, “at this time there is no convincing evidence for domain-specific circuitry for language.”, hence speaking for general nativism and putting a damper on Noam Chomsky’s Universal Grammar Theory.[5] During Self-regulated learning (<span class="smallcaps">Srl</span>), setting goals and choosing suitable learning techniques is elementary, the foci of second language learners should thus be geared towards applied linguistics’ empirically verified language learning techniques instead of more general, philosophical hypothesis, if the goal is efficient L2 acquisition.</p>

<p>The declarative/procedural model supports both general nativism, as well as the general approach taken by linguist Stephen Krashen, because it has been shown than “learning to identify relatively simple parts of language, such as words, is facilitated by effortful learning, whereas learning more complex aspects of language, such as grammatical features, is impeded by effortful learning”.[6] The former equates to declarative memory, learning of language morphology—word roots, affixes, conjugation, etc.—mentioned in the latter would be helped with procedural memory system usage. Both immersion<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and deliberate practice[8] have their place.</p>

<p>Stephen Krashen’s approach focuses on compelling, comprehensible input in form of free voluntary reading [9] —meaning the extensive type— that is effective when around 98% of vocabulary in the input text is known.[10] The spaced repetition learning approach is based on the spacing and testing effect studied in psychology. Long-term potentiation in neuroscience denotes a type of persistently amplified signaling between neural circuits, and is cited as an underlying factor for the validity of the mentioned phenomena.[11] Spaced repetition is what active recall over increasing time intervals is called, and is a promising optimization of memory capability.[12] [13]
The mental work done during active recall is most effectively used when one is just about to forget what one has learned—this is usually the case with increasing time intervals.[14] Spaced repetition software (<span class="smallcaps">Srs</span>) has been in development since the 1980, to implement an optimal utilization of this effect. In 1987, Piotr Wozniak implemented the first algorithm for computer-based flashcards with SM-2, which modern popular options like anki are largely based on.[15] [16]
Since the exact forgetting intervals can at most be approximated stochastically, an adaptation of these must be transmitted by the user with reference to the concrete remembering success for each card; pell-mell execution will not work, deliberate practice is imperative.</p>

<p>Flashcards based on a frequency dictionary’s word list derived from an appropriate corpus assures targeted initial vocabulary acquisition. For initial grammar acquisition, reading through frequency sequenced sentences exhibiting different grammatical structures, like example sentences from a grammar workbook is helpful. As a next step up from corpora based on subtitles, that belong to the <span class="smallcaps">Subtlex</span> movement and are more aligned with spoken language than the traditional text based corpora, tools like Subs2Srs can be utilized to generate flashcards of sentences from subtitled content.[17] Epub formatted eBooks too can manually, or rather likely via regular expressions, be converted into <span class="smallcaps">Srs</span> readable format, paving the way towards extended reading. Generating narration from these book passages with <span class="smallcaps">Tts</span> engines, like coqui-tts for python, could assist focus while reading and improve listening comprehension. Interactive conversation with large language models (<span class="smallcaps">Llm</span>) and usage of neural network based translators will likely amount to a paradigm shift in how and for what reason languages are learned in the near future. I imagine <span class="smallcaps">Sla</span> will be less important for communication, and become even more about virtue signalling like sports competitions.</p>

<p>The significant interplay between target language and its associated culture has been laid out above via Rawls and area studies.</p>

<p>But knowledge management certainly also has a negative connotation due to its misguided usage in the milieu of status-seeking productivity-optimization and self quantification; as an end in itself.[1] A tendency of information hoarding may also be a sign of self-justification of excessive distraction seeking via information consumption. Nevertheless, the notion of writing to forget, or let go of thoughts and ideas, alone could substantiate such practices as practical release valve as long as one is aware of the rationale behind them.</p>

<h4 id="information-science">Information Science</h4>

<p>As an individual’s personal space of information (<span class="smallcaps">Psi</span>), now increasingly shifts from the physical to the digital, and with growing importance of human–computer interaction (<span class="smallcaps">Hci</span>), digital <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>[2] becomes the main resource for information keeping and <span class="smallcaps">Pkm</span>. As knowledge is only indirectly manageable,[3] <span class="smallcaps">Pkm</span> is regarded a subset of <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> and should, for my taste, also utilize spaced repetition to facilitate learning as its primary objective. With that, <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> also involves the cognitive science fields of problem solving and decision making.</p>

<p>Within information science, the field of <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> is unique in its self-directed nature, curation and retrieval of items is done by the same entity. The user-subjective approach describes the need for flexibility of a given system to adapt to its user, enabling incorporation of various information fragments into a single structure. Primacy effect[4] and the active categorization required are most likely responsible for the preference of <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>-system design into folder trees and its traversal via navigation, in contrast to search functions, tagging, or relationship graphs. Information fragmentation is a problem exaggerated by the ever increasing amount of information items created and amount of external services used, thus the ability to export user data has to be a prerequisite. Digitization of non born-digital assets can be performed to consolidate the <span class="smallcaps">Psi</span>.</p>

<h5 id="file-management">File Management</h5>

<p>File Management is about designing systems for information and data preservation. Data preservation is concerned with present time data loss prevention and thereby protection of privacy, but also goes beyond that by anticipating usablility, integrity and other potential data object changes in the future. Data loss prevention is a prerequisite for further preservation and is most basally implemented with a backup scheme.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Future-proofing is ensured by using established standards for file management structures and file formats to make renderability more likely and future retrieval more convenient. Further, time-tested and widely used <span class="smallcaps">Foss</span> often has a higher chance of maintained development in comparison to proprietary software alternatives.</p>

<p>Implementing hierarchical folder-tree structures, analogous to the use of universal decimal classification (<span class="smallcaps">Udc</span>)[5] and <span class="smallcaps">Ddc</span> in library classification demands compromises in content allocation edge cases, but rewards with reduced infrastructure maintainance work and clarity.
If decimal classification is used to name certain classes of files that can actually benefit from it, it has to be considered that for most file managers, numerical sorting is the default, meaning <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5 &lt; 22 &lt; 100</code>. This has to be disabled, as the numbers in this scheme are used as if they were decimals, hence <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.100 &lt; .22 &lt; .5</code>. Grouping in decimal classification follows defined categories, the need for interlinking notes, as is required with nonhierarchical relationship graphs, wikis or tagging systems, is limited. Traversing the distance between two related nodes within the data structure should minimize involvement of ancestors.</p>

<p>There should be content type dependent file naming conventions. For sorting purposes, the most relevant metadata is stated first. While books could be named via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UDC - Title - Author - Year</code>, others types may be sorted by initializing the filename with <span class="smallcaps">Iso</span>–8601 (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2021-11-12</code>). Choosing the correct date to associate with a file can be tricky in some cases, for example consider a video shot in 2000, published in 2012 and introduced to the <span class="smallcaps">Psi</span> in 2020. Plain hierarchical folders are not the best fit for all applications, they can however be expanded to serve as storage location for, hence working in conjunction with, tag editor generated databases to the benefit of image categorization.</p>

<p>Studies advocate for the GrayArea concept [6], [7]. A GrayArea is implemented as a gray area in each folder, enabling relevance classification of data into a third state between keep and delete by graying files out. Personally, the concept of GrayArea seems like a bad one, because you simply shift the issue around. I nonetheless use an auxiliary-folder named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!tmp</code>, that can be used as an incorporation buffer for files violating naming conventions, with the distinction that its temporal aspect is eponymous.
With regular backups, and versioning being taken care of, the caution threshold for removing data is lowered to break the tendency of overkeeping.</p>

<h5 id="notes-and-annotations">Notes and Annotations</h5>

<p>Since plain text is the most flexible, writing in a lightweight markup language, in this case Markdeep-js markup syntax, is the best option.
Markdeep allows writing browser-accessible html documents in an extended markdown syntax, with the caveat that browsers do not support <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XMLHttpRequest</code> to the local file system or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell.openPath()</code>, so files from the local file system cannot be opened by the browser with a local application <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
Over time, however, simply reading and writing these files in a text editor proved to be the most practical, making its ability to generate html somewhat obsolete.
Even for personal notes, having a certain standard in relation to style and reference management will ensure they can contribute to potentially distributable assets <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h5 id="reference-management">Reference Management</h5>

<p>Output generation like non-fiction writing is build upon a foundation of curating and validation checking sources. A structured information input, as shown in the graph, facilitates this. One has to be aware that this can make consumption seem more productive and worthwhile than it probably is, just because you create a record of it does not mean that it was worth your time. The file naming conventions for different content types from file management result in the ability to convert a list of filenames with regular expressions to a desired metadata format. XML is the lingua franca for serialization of information, other formats suffice when the given file’s conversion to a pandas dataframe or manipulation with regular expressions is straightforward, as is the case for .csv and .bib files. Thusly, tools to be utilized are required to offer those export schemes.
The biblatex format is a good option in combination with the Jabref reference manager and the pandoc document conversion software used to generate various types of output documents from the notes and references.
In libraries, the subject cataloging facilitated by decimal classification is usually augmented with controlled vocabulary tagging, e.g. Library of Congress Subject Headings or GND (Gemeinsame Normdatei). While this is helpful for information retrieval, it has a high maintenance cost as biblatex is far from ideal for this application. Defining a custom bibliography style for custom entry-types and -fields is very involved, but would be necessary to keep the records in line with other authority files (wikidata, GND). Bibliographic records can be hierarchically structured into work, expression, manifestation and item (WEMI). Biblatex is designed to cover only the manifestation subset.</p>

<p>On the plus side, in mp3tag, the audio file metadata tag editor, a custom export filter can be defined to export albums as entries to biblatex format.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$filename(bib,utf-8)

$loop(%albumartist%,1)
$loop(%album%,1)
$puts(NumberOfAlbums,$add($get(NumberOfAlbums),1))
@%contentgroup%{%contentgroup%_$put(val,$add($get(val),1)),
  author           = {{%contentgroup%_$put(val,$add($get(val),1)),
  author           = {{%artist%}},
  date             = {%year%},
  publisher        = {%label%},
  title            = {%album%},
  subtitle         = {%title%},
  totaltracks      = {%totaltracks%},
  file             = {:%_directory%/%_filename_ext%:%_extension%},
  genre            = {%genre%},
  creationdate     = {%_date%},
  modificationdate = {%_date%},
}
$loopend()
$puts(TotalAlbums,$add($get(TotalAlbums),$get(NumberOfAlbums)))
$puts(NumberOfAlbums,0)
$loopend()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Jabref too, custom export templates can be created to export data as desired. These two cover most content types adequately with the notable exception of images. digiKam is a FOSS image tag editor to organize images, what it lacks is a way to export a spreadsheet of image metadata from the populated database. This is useful if storing tags within the file, or doubling the file count by using XMP sidecar files is undesired. By default, digiKam stores metadata in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">digikam4.db</code> sqlite database. There are no custom fields or any kind of build-in metadata export in digiKam, thus it is not a perfect solution. The following generates a table with filenames and associated tags.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-- !!! Generate a table with filename and corresponding tags from digikam4.db
-- this table has the tagid and the corresponding tag name
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t1 AS 
SELECT tagid, name 
FROM ImageTags 
INNER JOIN tags ON tags.id = tagid 
GROUP BY tagid;

-- this table replaced imagetags.tagid with the tag name
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t2 AS 
SELECT imageid, name 
FROM ImageTags 
INNER JOIN t1 ON ImageTags.tagid = t1.tagid;

-- we concat the tag names that belong to an image id, and show the filename for each image id
SELECT images.name AS 'FileName', GROUP_CONCAT(t2.name, '; ') AS 'Tags'
FROM t2 
INNER JOIN images ON images.id = imageid 
GROUP BY imageid;

-- we remove the temporary tables 
DROP TABLE t1;
DROP TABLE t2;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="episteme">Episteme</h4>

<p>Paintings as products of culture are influenced by trends, novelties and current affairs shaping its substantiating society. Considering movable easel-paintings gradually superseded wall-painting’s dominance only in the 14th. century, just like all representations of artistic expression, paintings are neither in form nor in subject a cultural constant. Akin to a sport’s contrived rules, constraining properties of forms of art are a feature. Unleashed from church walls, artists could use their easel-paintings to trade, establishing an art market with the feudal lords as new clientele, then broadening to the middle class after the French Revolution.[1] Not long after, in 1839, invention of the Daguerreotype photographic process presents the low-cost and time efficient alternative of portrait photography to painted portraiture. Democratization of pictorial media by this novel imaging method naturally impacted the conception of a painting’s function and its placement in the hierarchy of art forms by their significance.</p>

<p>Adorno’s essay “Kunst und die Künste” argues, that though the new is not eo ipso better, even the weak manifestation of willingness to modernize bears more productive force than resistance to zeitgeist. Therefore painters have no choice but to deal with the crisis of meaning modern technology presents.[2] For Adorno, by its aesthetic properties, art suggests meaning within the meaningless.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The meaning behind art and a definition of a work’s aesthetic properties were pondered in earlier posts, but considerations about creating an environment encouraging these characteristics seems like a useful addition. Perceptibility of aesthetic properties can differ between art forms, one might be more susceptible to certain stimuli. Thus distilling a form’s unique component, that constitutes this incalculable property, should catalyze assignment of meaning and distinctability in its functioning among the arts.</p>

<p>In the hope of finding an answer, I read several painting related chapters, including “Malerei als »Diskursarena« und als Kunst” in “Kunst und die Künste”. Rather unexpectedly, the conclusion about how a painting mechanistically functions turned out to be very in line with what I came up with in “Painting #2”.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> The author identifies three actuators compounding to a painting’s entirety. Physically manifested as a continuous planar object, the painting ground is covered with paint introducing, from a praxeological perspective, indexicality with a reflexive referral to the authorial entity [Handschriftlichkeit]. From a medium perspective, the canvas is filled in with color, to create the illusion of reality; despite no reference in the essay, I would equate this point of view with the Bildakt theory, the emergence of an aesthetic subject within the art-object. Can we deduce a practice for adjusting paintings to optimally utilize this structural make-up of actuators?</p>

<p>According to art critic Clement Greenberg, a focus on a painting’s flatness defined the evasive maneuver artists undertook from the mid 19th century up to the contemporary art movements of the 1970s to cope with photography, to stay distinctive and relevant. It rid itself from the veil of sculptural illusion, by self-critical reevaluation redefining the modern painting’s understanding of the self. Abstraction, closer to arbitrary object but more unequivocally modern and unique than ever before, in painting is not the end of the story. A contemporary art movement often called Photorealism started in the 1960s and is diametrically opposing the previous centuries trends and supposed enlightenment about what a painting ought to be.</p>

<p>Painting seeped into popular culture, the plethora of resulting opinions questioned the practice of art criticism itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Nothing was clearer than the inadequacy of the then-going critical apparatus.” —[4]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contemporary artists almost seemed to purposefully invalidate the canonical body of analytical theories with their work. The Photorealists’ aim to reproduce objects indistinguishable from a photographic depiction of the subject matter, appeared void of purpose and meaning; no style, no Handschriftlichkeit. This interpretation inhibiting literalness emanates visual objectivity but ambiguity in meaning, often interpreted by the beholder as a task to simply recognise the aesthetic encountered in everyday objects. Validity of this analysis is only given under the presumption that photographs, and by proxy their attempted painstaking duplication in oils, are objective. Photographs are neither transparent, because they do not necessarily show what they mean, nor are they—as subject to selection—objective. Photorealism’s ostensible neutralism is ultimately a critical examination of contemporary visual mass media’s assumed objectivity and verisimilitude.</p>

<p>Truly, photorealism is an unfitting term for this genre of new figurative painting, this invitation to juxtapose reality and its illusionary recreation; works not striving for perfection and “ideological indeterminacy”, but upon closer inspection questioning reality by making objective imagery—in Weinberg’s words—“strange”.[4] Redefinition as new figurative painting allows expression of the psychological moment of the individual painted and its sincerity as the thematic focal point, while photorealism undermines such dimension.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Certainly not exclusive to painting as an artform, its permutability nevertheless appears to be its most essential asset and reason for the art world’s continuous assignation of relevance to painting. The future might hold a renaissance of Handschriftlichkeit—marks of ragged manual labor turning desirable—as reactive response to AI generated art, questioning not the objective, but the calculable. A permanent shift towards digital painting as the next evolutionary step is also possible; time will tell.</p>

<h4 id="colorimetry">Colorimetry</h4>

<p>As we concluded above, the intermingling of painting related analog and digital production processes will only increase.
For painting it is crucial to understand how human color perception works and how colors are transformed and represented from the analog to the digital and vice versa.<br />
The human eye can perceive color via excitement of three types of cone cells, called long, medium and short.
The cones are concentrated in the fovea centralis, the observer’s field of view can be standardized by only accounting for the response of a certain area on the retina around the fovea. Common norms include the <span class="smallcaps">Cie</span> 2° and <span class="smallcaps">Cie</span> 10° standard observer.
The <span class="smallcaps">Lms</span> tristimulus values are the integration over the product of the spectral power distribution (<span class="smallcaps">Spd</span>) of the light that meets the eye, and the cones’ spectral sensitivity for a given visible wavelength.[6]</p>

\[L = \int_\lambda \Phi (\lambda) L (\lambda) d\lambda\]

\[M = \int_\lambda \Phi (\lambda) M (\lambda) d\lambda\]

\[S = \int_\lambda \Phi (\lambda) S (\lambda) d\lambda\]

<p>The retina’s cells send these stimuli as chemical signals through the optic nerve to the brain.
This <span class="smallcaps">Lms</span> color model is the most basal of objective human vision representations, however it does not qualify as a color appearance model (<span class="smallcaps">Cam</span>), as those go beyond mostly quantifiable measures and attempt to take into account more subjective perception parameters influencing a color’s appearance as interpreted by the brain.
The <span class="smallcaps">Cie</span> 1931 <span class="smallcaps">Xyz</span> model, defined decades before the understanding of the visual processes in the eye, is also able to represent all possible cone cell responces, making it analogous to <span class="smallcaps">Lms</span> by the Hunt-Pointer-Estevez conversion matrix.</p>

\[\begin{bmatrix}
    X  \\
    Y  \\
    Z  \\
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1.91020 &amp; -1.11212 &amp; 0.20191 \\
    0.37095 &amp; \phantom{-}0.62905  &amp; 0 \\
    0       &amp; \phantom{-}0        &amp; 1.00000 \\
  \end{bmatrix}_{HPE}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    L  \\
    M  \\
    S  \\
  \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>The <span class="smallcaps">Xyz</span> model is useful, as it can be converted into the <span class="smallcaps">Cie</span> 1931 xyY model, where Y gives the brightness of a color, and the xy plane the chromacity in the <span class="smallcaps">Cie</span> 1931 xy chromaticity diagram.</p>

\[x = \frac{X}{X+Y+Z}\]

\[y = \frac{Y}{X+Y+Z}\]

<p>While the diagram encompasses all visible colors, a real world reasonable-effort hue reproduction is limited by the choosen primary colors spanning a gamut in the xy-plane. <span class="smallcaps">Cie</span> 1931 <span class="smallcaps">Rgb</span> is one of such limited color spaces that by metamerism can reproduce a large subset of hues with just three monochromatic sources for the theoretical reference illuminant E, defining its white point and assigning a constant <span class="smallcaps">Spd</span> for all visible wavelengths.
Another <span class="smallcaps">Rgb</span> colorspace is the web standard s<span class="smallcaps">Rgb</span> with the reference illuminant D65.
To convert s<span class="smallcaps">Rgb</span> to <span class="smallcaps">Xyz</span>, we first have to normalize, then linearize the vector’s values, done by inverse s<span class="smallcaps">Rgb</span> companding.[7]</p>

\[\vec{v}_{rgb} = \begin{cases}
        \frac{\vec{V}_{RGB} }{12.92}                            &amp; \text{if } \vec{V}_{RGB} \leq 0.04045 \\
        \left(\frac{\vec{V}_{RGB} +0.055}{1.055}\right)^{2.4}   &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\]

<p>The conversion matrix can be calculated with the following coordinates in the xy plane for the s<span class="smallcaps">Rgb</span> color model.[8]</p>

\[\begin{Bmatrix}
    x_r &amp; y_r &amp; x_g &amp; y_g &amp; x_b &amp; y_b &amp; X_{2°} &amp; Y_{2°} &amp; Z_{2°}\\
    0.64 &amp; 0.33 &amp; 0.3 &amp; 0.6 &amp; 0.15 &amp; 0.06 &amp; 0.95047 &amp; 1.0 &amp; 1.08883\\
  \end{Bmatrix}\]

\[\begin{align*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      X\\
      Y\\
      Z
    \end{bmatrix} &amp;= 
    \begin{bmatrix}
            {S_r \frac{x_r}{x_r}}                   &amp; {S_g \frac{x_g}{y_g}}                 &amp; {S_b \frac{x_b}{y_b}} \\ 
            {S_r}                                   &amp; {S_g}                                 &amp; {S_b} \\ 
            {S_r \frac{1 - x_r - y_r}{y_r}}         &amp; {S_g \frac{1 - x_g - y_g}{y_g}}       &amp; {S_b \frac{1 - x_b - y_b}{y_b}}       
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    R\\
    G\\
    B
    \end{bmatrix}\\
    \text{ with } 
    \begin{bmatrix}
            S_r\\
            S_g\\
            S_b
    \end{bmatrix} &amp;= 
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{x_r}{x_r} &amp; \frac{x_g}{y_g} &amp; \frac{x_b}{y_b} \\ 
      1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 
      \frac{1 - x_r - y_r}{y_r} &amp; \frac{1 - x_g - y_g}{y_g} &amp; \frac{1 - x_b - y_b}{y_b}
    \end{bmatrix}^{-1} 
    \begin{bmatrix}
      X_{2°}\\
      Y_{2°}\\
      Z_{2°}
    \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align*}\]

<p>Now, <span class="smallcaps">Xyz</span> values can be converted to spectral reflectance curves for the D65 illuminant thanks to the methods presented in the paper “Numerical methods for smoothest reflectance reconstruction” by Scott A. Burns.[9] The paper’s third method is also referred to as “Least Hyperbolic Tangent Slope Squared (<span class="smallcaps">Lhtss</span>) algorithm” on the author’s website.
By, what I could gather, using the mathematical optimization method of Lagrange multipliers, the minimum of the first derivative squard of the function is numerically approximated via Newton’s method until the tolerance condition is met. $T$ is a matrix for the <span class="smallcaps">Cie</span> 1931 2-deg physiologically-relevant fundamental color matching function (<span class="smallcaps">Cmf</span>) according to Stockman &amp; Sharpe (2000).[10]</p>

\[\min \sum(z_{i+1} - z_i)^2 \text{ such that } T \left(\frac{\tanh(z)+1}{2}\right) = \vec{v}_{XYZ}%is it v_XYZ?\]

<p>You, the attentive reader, might wonder what the point of this section could be. The paper proposes a method for calculating an approximate spectral reflectance curve from sRGB values. By fitting the spectral reflectance of a set of oil paints to this function, it may be possible to calculate ideal color mixing recipes, minimal palettes and waste less paint trying to match the specific colors of a reference picture in a rather simple fashion. Of course, even more sophisticated tools already seem to exist,[11] a circumstance that franky saddens and demotivates me somewhat; why arduously learn to mix paints, when one can get better results with a MATLAB/Octave script? Does one have to use all available tools to not be disadvantaged?
I mentioned Dall-E2 in the last painting related post, since then more advanced ML/AI tools like Stable Diffusion were released; I have to accept that the clock can not be turned back; resistance to zeitgeist is futile after all.</p>

<h4 id="techne">Techne</h4>

<p>I do not want to make the impression that my act of painting is actually well conceived, or as portentous as the writing would make you believe. I needlessly burden myself with an earnest sense of duty to improve my painting, because I rely on it a little too much for my self-esteem, but else it is just a rewarding, and even sporadically relaxing endeavor.</p>

<p>The coastal, breezy atmosphere I was looking for was well replicated from the reference in this painting, the partially blurred environment reflects itself in, and dictates the subject’s impression, rather than the other way around, while not taking away the beholder’s attention from the details presented in the foreground.
The photograph might not show it, but my continuous efforts to improve the color gamut of my paintings paid off and the color accuracy improved. I first tried to mix the greens with Phthalo Green Blue Shade PG7, but it looked artificially intense for scrubs exposed to a scorching summer sun. A mixture of Cerulian PB35 and Winsor Yellow PY74 worked well. Sized at just 40⨯30cm, the scene’s depiction demanded some sacrifices in accuracy, however adjustments to the foreground details beyond this point may have been noticable on a photograph, but under normal lighting conditions and a reasonable distance the perceptible in-person quality is fine.</p>

<p>I changed my varnishing process, because my gamvar was used up.
I switched to Schmincke retouching varnish, because it allows the layering of a final picture varnish, I felt would be beneficial for archival purposes, as opposed to just using gamvar.
By letting the paint cure for four weeks after the final adjusting brushstrokes, the application of the retouching varnish resulted in a recognizably superior color revitalization compared to gamvar. Possible explanations for this discrepancy include time- and surface-conditioned fading of gamvar’s gloss effect property, or the inadequacy of a singular gamvar application layer; the latter could be resolved, but is just as inconvenient as the former.
Considering the archival adequacy of final picture varnish, and its supposedly improved quality over the retouching varnish, waiting a few weeks is certainly worth it.
Even with very thin paint layers, the minor lifting of paint due to the Naphtha (white spirit) base in Schmincke retouching varnish was not a big issue.</p>

This is the follow-up to the Information Management post.</p>

<p>Once a piece of nonfiction is written based on collected information, one should give due consideration to copyediting with style guidelines like “The Chicago Manual of Style” by the University of Chicago Press[1], “The Elements of Style” by William Strunk Jr.[2] and “The Economist Style Guide” by Ann Wroe[3] for consistent quality in writing.</p>

<h4 id="choice-of-format">Choice of Format</h4>

<p>A document refers to an object, which stores information that serve as a record. Accessability of information is thereby the primary function of documentation.
Different means of access require different modes of presentation.
Starting from the most adaptable format, plain text, based on the intended function of the document, one can choose a fitting format for proceeding with refining the type and layout.
A good combination of markup languages is LaTeX for PDFs and html+css for WWW or EPUB, both complementarily compensating each others shortcomings, henceforward I would like to focus my deliberations on those.</p>

<p>The plain text document base still requires a minimum of markup, with markdown and org-mode<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> being the most prominent lightweight markup languages.
At this stage, the document is not for public sharing, but certain standards like proper citations should be considered to serve as a useful source later on.
A good fit is the pandoc document converter software, with extensible conversion operations to LaTeX and html+css from its pandoc flavored markdown specification.
Markdown documents can be initialized with a YAML metadata block to denote the author, date and title.
By using the extended pandoc markdown syntax, sources can be cited from a biblatex file with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[@CiteKey]</code> and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.csl</code> citation style file; further footnotes may be added by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[^Key]</code>, immensely reducing the amount of adjustments and typesetting required to produce reasonable results for both LaTeX and html based formats from a single text. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">raw_attribute</code> extension allows conversion format conditional text blocks. The pandoc output can be improved with custom regular expression substitutions pre and post conversion, for example in python with a the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subprocess</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">re</code> standard libraries.
Though compromises have to be made by adhering to this smallest common denominator of a simple markdown syntax, it ensures a quicker workflow and is a good starting point for more refined typesetting later on.</p>

<p>Most documents will benefit from including vector graphics and diagrams as pictorial, yet abstract, representations of information. Graph drawing tools include inkscape, graphviz, diagrams.net and PGF/TikZ.</p>

<p>In this Figure we see the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>By not using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--template</code> option for generating a PDF in pandoc, but inputting the generated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tex</code> files as mainmatter, a regular LaTeX document template can be used and adjusted. A batch file is used to remove the aux files of each post’s standalone PDF document. In addition, a combined document with all posts is created.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Converted to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">markdown_strict</code>, the generated document will work with the markdown based static site generator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Multiple bibliography files can be merged and entry inclusion be filtered by post association to keep this main bibliography up to date. The title field needs to be protected by curly brackets, because pandoc’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--citeproc</code> conversion from biblatex to Citation Style Language metadata disregards the title case. It also does not work properly with CJK field content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pandoc’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--template</code> option is used to prepare the output file for inclusion in the LaTeX template in the next step with the metadata from the input file’s yaml header.</p>

  <li>
    <p>A python script is executed via shell functions that convert the inputs into standalone PDFs, EPUBs and a static website.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is where one has to write the text, while adhering to a style guide.</p>
  </li>

    <p>The EPUB format uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--mathml</code> for formulas, and lua filters to maintain the correct image path across all formats</p>

<a href="/assets/img/documentdesign-20230226Template.zip" target="_blank">ZIP</a></i></p>

<p>For PDF generation, LaTeX and its document classes enable the design of many types of documents from books, presentations and articles, to letters, flashcards or curriculum vitae.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The mainly used template of mine can adapt to different design requirements, by alteration of the document structure based on assigned boolean inputs for conditional statements in the main document.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>\documentclass[]{this_class}
\newcommand\true{1}

%------------------------------------------------
%   Document layout (0=false 1=true)
%------------------------------------------------
\newcommand\conditionA{0}

\usepackage{style} 

%------------------------------------------------
%   Document structure
%------------------------------------------------
\begin{document}

\ifx\conditionA\true
    \input{contentA}
\else
    \input{contentB}
\fi

\end{document}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A good document viewer for the output PDF is SumatraPDF, because it allows you to change the background and text color for reading in low light conditions.</p>

<p>The LaTeX template has multiple cover options.
Lightweight options are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maketitle</code> for short documents, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">titlepage</code> environment, or inputting an external background and writing on top of it with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eso-pic</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">textpos</code> packages.</p>

<p>A simple titlepage is the best option for most extensive documents, but if you want to make a bound print copy of your text, you are best served by a proper book cover including a spine.
LaTeX might not be the best option for most styles of cover artwork and one would be better served with a vector graphics editor like inkscape, but covers reminiscent of the New Typography movement could certainly be created without too much of a hassle.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
It becomes clear why that is, if we consider the history of typography.</p>

<p>The 15th century saw the invention of the printing press, imitating the medieval handwritten manuscript design and black letter typeface.
Around the turn of the century in Italy, antiqua typefaces (roman and italic type) where developed with printing in mind, increasing the bodytext’s fluency.
Italian Renaissance culture spread throughout Europe by impetus of the Italian wars from 1494 to 1559 and saw innovations by the French, like Garamond.
The popularity of antiqua initiated the subsequent design of Fraktur in Germany, a mellowed but as the name suggests, still distinctly fractured black letter typeface.
The cultural influence of the French Rococo, sealed the transition towards French antiqua as the dominant class of typefaces across most of Europe.
Clear and simple forms and the contrast in stroke thickness of French antiqua types prompt a logical progression in step with the themes of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries.
Modern roman typefaces from Didot employ mathematical precision and geometric shapes.
The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century spawned new production processes.
The need for flashy, “grotesque” display and advertisement fonts along with trends in modern art, makes sans serif a popular alternative to antiqua in a broadening array of use cases.
1920s’ New Typography movement is a reactive response to late 19th century Art nouveau inspired printing, considered retrogressive due to its reintroduction of ornaments, by modernist typographers like Jan Tschichold, Herbert Bayer and László Moholy-Nagy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The essence of the New Typography is clarity. This puts it into deliberate opposition to the old typography whose aim was”beauty” and whose clarity did not attain the high level we require today. ” — The New Typography by Jan Tschichold 1928, p.66 <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I consider TeX to be a consistent progression of this mentality, but focusing less on merely exposing a printed pieces essential function, and more on providing the designer with a toolset to convey their message, allowing for a sliver of artistic expression.
Even Tschichold himself repudiated his books intolerant and strict claim to absoluteness after reconsidering his cultural bias in light of World War II.</p>

<p>When the document is about to be printed, the printing company will provide the required cover measurements based on their production process and the selected paper thickness. Consider that the inner margin of long documents may have to be increased due to folding. The spine should follow ISO-6357 according to which the text should run from top to bottom, when the book is upright.</p>

<figcaption><i><b>Fig. 2:</b> XeLaTeX custom cover design demonstration converted to .svg for better browser support</i></figcaption>

<p>This design mainly utilizes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bookcover</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xcoffins</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tikz</code> packages and imitates, in parts, the 1925 issue “sonderheft elementare typografie” of the magazine “typografische mitteilungen”, based on an exemplary implementation.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="webpage-template">Webpage Template</h4>

<p>The html+css style for the World Wide Web should be somewhat congruent with the LaTeX template. The static site generator takes pandoc’s output markdown files, executes the conversion to html and applies the template accordingly.
As html+css is not agnostic to the document viewer’s dimensions, insisting on ideal replication is both unfeasible and unnecessary. It’s adaptability requires new guidelines; for example, whereas in PDF’s there is no need to strip images of their metadata individually, images included in html documents should be examined with exiftool prior to publication. I find that justified text does not look pleasing on websites, the interword spacing is often distracting.
As this website is build by the static site generator jekyll utilizing the minima theme, most of the publication design is determined by modifications to the predefined settings.[8] After quite a few iterations, I now gladly consider this publication design congruent with its intended function.
Notably, the orthographic best practices are independent of format and are applicable to all documents.
When in doubt, my reference of choice is the “Chicago Manual of Style” since even the best template requires copyediting.</p>

<p>As German law demands legal information such as legal notices and data privacy policies to be constantly and easily accessible from every subpage, integrating them in the global website footer is most convenient. In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_includes</code> folder, add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contact.html</code> in Liquid syntax to the theme’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">footer.html</code> and create those files. In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contact.html</code> just add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/pages/contact.md</code> in Liquid syntax, and create that path. With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">permalink: /contact/</code> in the document yaml-head, the legal notice will be build and linked correctly.</p>

<p>I added custom sub- and superscript css properties to eliminate line spacing irregularities caused by endnotes.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>//custom: eliminate line spacing irregularities
sup {
  vertical-align: super; 
  line-height: 1ex;
}

sub {
  vertical-align: sub;
  line-height: 1ex;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use_math: true/false</code> YAML field, only loading mathjax when needed. Mathjax’s CSS container <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mjx-container</code> should be changed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">overflow-x: auto;</code> for display math and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">overflow-x: hidden;</code> for inline math <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mjx-container:not([display])</code>, else the layout breaks with long equations and unneeded scrollbars.</p>

<h4 id="epub-template">EPUB Template</h4>

<p>For comfortable offline reading on screens, a pandoc conversion to EPUB is a good option.
EPUB is an open source, XML based format that supports both fixed and reflowable layout formatting and a subset of MathML; in effect, such a file is an archive that contains a website. For most types of electronic publications, EPUB should be superior to PDF since the content can be processed and extracted, for example with regular expressions.</p>

      <p>“The New Typography” by Jan Tschichold[6] reads contemporary despite being written around 100 years ago (1928). What would not surprise me with classic fiction, feels surprising for non fiction. The choice of vocabulary can be unexpected at times as the German author uses seemingly anglicised German words that must have either been more canonical English words back then, or the suitable terms were unascertainable, which is equally peculiar from a modern standpoint.
“The Art of Type and Typography” by Mary Jo Krysinski[7] is a modern introduction to typography. Intended as supplementary textbook for the “Beginning Typography” class at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, there are both assignments and a heavy focus on the usage of Adobe® InDesign® software. Among my learnings is the use of small-caps, as to not interfere with the overall font weight distribution when using abbreviations.
My favorite fonts include “Consolas”, a monospaced sans serif font I use in text editors; “Futura”, developed based on geometric shapes in 1928 by German artist and designer Paul Renner and “Computer Modern Bright”, part of the Computer Modern family of typefaces designed by Donald Knuth. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>It seems to be a given, that artworks have certain qualities, which are desired by their onlookers, prompting the production of paintings with the goal to profit from said desires.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Commissions and reproductions are preceded by a market demand, making the production less risky for the artist. A driver of value for original work is evidently it’s uniqueness, or as proxy for that the risk of the investment into it’s creation, as one can not be sure the work or style will be desired, thus the market discounts the value of replicas based on the available information it possesses about the risk reduction.</p>

<p>Paintings with realistic motive are limited in their stylistic choices cuing both commonness and risk reduction, hence value is mainly generated by the time invested and technical ability required from the creator, a proof-of-work approach in an attempt to assert intrinsic value. The advent of photography in the 1830s meant paintings liberation from it’s representative function enabling a purely abstract use of the medium.[1] The photorealist movement of the 1970s can be seen as a successful renaissance, not only because of the proof-of-work aspect noted above, but also thanks to the unexpected—dare I say pointless—embracement of this style at that time, since the supposed goal of modern painting was thought to be, as described in Charles Baudelaire’s “Painter of Modern Life”, the “ability to create a world that distills the eternal from the transatory”. Advancements in <span class="smallcaps">art</span>ificial intelligence, new resources and tooling for traditional and digital art, simplifying the creation workflow, cause their perceived value qua invested resources to decrease over time in regards to the aforementioned indicators; a valuation subject to inflation which can only be counteracted by historic significance of the object.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>But this empirically observable “value market” is not informationally efficient; the demand is only minorly based on available, somewhat quantifiable information, or the artist’s “risk” of production; the object’s value largely correlates with the subjective onlooker’s personal taste. Due to it’s nature as an object sought for aesthetic appeal, the derivation of general laws of taste that could explain said correlation is obviated by the “indistinguishability” definition of aesthetic properties by Mary Mothersill.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The aesthetic properties of an individual O are those that define the class of items which, for a particular subject, S, under standard conditions, etc., are indistinguishable from O”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This contradicts Thomas Aquinas’s definition of beauty. He claims “beauty is not a concept in the mind of the beholder imposed onto a given object”, as “beauty resides in the object.”, making beauty a quantifiable measure.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> But, <i>de gustibus non est disputandum</i>. Would it not take a dualistic approach in the perception of beauty to explain the difficulty of taste consensus-building? Would one not have to allow for a subject’s predisposition; a subjective element in the cognition of beauty? The following quote from “Image and Insight”[3] explores this idea “the object of pleasure (the painting) is noncontingently related to the subject’s pleasure”, before referring to Freud’s theory that objects (of pleasure) can only be refound.</p>

<p>Ellen Handler Spitz then goes one step further and meets Horst Bredekamp with his Bildakt theory.[4] We now consider the art-object to act as a subject, interacting with the thusly beheld subject in this transactional model. Such approach “locates aesthetic pleasure in the subject (and) also in a dynamic in which the spectator-subject may become object to the aesthetic subject qua subject.”[3]</p>

<p>You could be led to belief, that the painter of the object is a mere bystander in this model, but au contraire it is said that “a viewer can identify with the artist’s unconscious desires expressed through sublimation”[5] via the painting. The aesthetic subject is shaped by, and serves as a “means of giving expression to, and dealing with, various psychic pressures”<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> of the artist. Maybe like a child relates to their parents, the creation is both an independent entity as well as a reflection of it’s creator’s inner workings. As someone who has had a tendency for perfectionism in painting matters, the parable constructed ex supra is calming. Your responsibility is limited, at some point it is on the painting and the spectator to find each other.</p>

<h4 id="another-painting">Another Painting</h4>

<p>The time I can allocate to painting in it’s function as an end in itself pastime is sadly limited.
I can’t help but have a sense of urgency, making productive use of my time painting, on the rare occasion the prerequisites of sufficient time and right mood are fulfilled.
It is imperative that I know about challenges likely to arise, and that I don’t lose interest due to complications and delays, as it takes a long time to complete, even without them.
I am hesitant to alter my motive too drastically, though I will look for some new aspects that I can introduce to expand my repertoire.</p>

<p>This time around, among these new aspects is a renewed focus on high contrast imagery, i.e. sizable areas near the black- and white-point.
I think the improvements are more noticeable in person, the photographs taken are still not entirely satisfactory.
If I compare these photos with ones taken of other’s paintings, I can’t fathom how great they must look in person, though my work’s small dimensions could have a lot to do with this.</p>

<p>Another obvious novelty is the facial expression, the lag of opened eyes as a point of orientation and the inclusion of laughter lines were the main new challenges this time around.</p>

<h4 id="python-fu-function-experiment">Python-fu Function Experiment</h4>

<p>Mentioning points of orientation, I have recently experimented with gimp’s python-fu functionality to create a routine called “outlined” that could create a characteristic outline of an image for usage as a fast, transferable underdrawing template generator.
I should mention that I have yet to use this procedure—likely will never—for any project, because now that I see it’s output, I’m convinced it would not be helpful, even with lots of manual adjustments, remotely as much as I would like it to.
My main goal was to get familiar with python and gimp, and that I accomplished; I only share it here to show off some dead ends in my process of creating paintings, and because it took me a long time to write.<br />
This proposed function could have improved the process of painting from a reference image, but as declared ex supra, it would also beg the question at what point the artist becomes a servant to the computer’s calculations.</p>

<p>The quote “The Photo-Realist uses the camera and photograph to gather information. The Photo-Realist uses a mechanical or semi-mechanical means to transfer the information to the canvas.”, is part of the definition of Photorealists by Louis K. Meisel from 1972. As we are now further along the Digital Age timeline, the helpful tools for Computer-aided digital image to photorealistic oil painting reproduction assistance have advanced qua the introduction of image processing software; potentially providing the painter with data points about color pigment mixing and placement optimizations. Should all available tools be used to create the envisioned end product, or should the end product be valued based on the assistance it received as it was created?</p>

<p>After some searching, the above image [7] resulted in the best output.
What I noticed is that, because the outlining happens in a for-loop, the outline is applied to the outlineless image for each iteration.
This would not be possible without a script, as the standart border selection tool in the <span class="smallcaps">Gui</span> would work with the partly outlined image for each subsequent color, resulting in outlined area borders with twice the thickness.</p>

<p>The following use-caseless code, for Windows, is located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">...\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outlined.py</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is a rather risky matter to discuss a happiness that has no need of words.” ― Yukio Mishima, Sun and Steel<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> [1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Presuppose you are toying with the somewhat existentialist idea, that the goal in life is to find a way to distract yourself from the fact, that there is—at least inherently—no meaning.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
With that said, the ability to choose ‘distracting’ activities you declare meaningful substantiates why striving for physical health is more fulfilling than spending your time in a restricted, unwell state.
The special eurobarometer survey on sport and physical activity in the <span class="smallcaps">Eu</span>[5], finds that the share of people who never participate in sport has increased over the past years to almost 50%, alleging that a lag of time and interest are the leading causes, while health and fitness improvements, as well as relaxation are the primary motivators. Significant indicators for increased physical activity are being male, being in a younger age group, finishing formal education later in life, higher financial freedom and rural living.
As long as you are able to spare some time, how can a sport’s contrived challenge foster meaning and motivate beyond the apparently insufficient, ascertained reasons by the survey?
To quote the book “Introduction to the Philosophy of Sport”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> by Heather Lynne Reid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We begin, as Plato and Aristotle did, with an appreciation of sport’s autotelicity—the notion that it is (at least ideally) an end in itself, done for its own sake, without the need of external purpose or justification.” [6]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The autotelicity mirrors a sense of pointlessness in life, facilitating the translateability of learned in-game behavior and procedures into real life situations.
You could say that a sports’ existence precedes its essence, the latter indispensably emerges through virtuous practice, as an athlete’s skill is not valuable because of the sports performance it produces, but because a skill obtained through virtue can find application, and result in good, outside the game.
Advanced capacity to navigate the world around you can be a motivation to participate in sport; but admittedly, the tolerance to delayed gratification induced by autotelicity varies from person to person and few people will be convinced by the declared line of arguments alone, to start lifting weights.
With this type of physical activity there is a more straightforward reason that comes to mind, improving outward appearance.
At this point, I would like to make another lemma, a distinction between sports focused on performance and those focused on aesthetics, namely bodybuilding.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Aesthetics is incidental in sport, whereas, in art, it is the principal aim. Therefore, sport is not an art.” [7]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With regard to the categorization via the quote ex supra, bodybuilding’s artistic dimension directly—at times involuntarily—signals virtuous behavior even outside the game, amplifying the motivation for athletes, but also potentiating social pressures; as art concerns something beyond itself, the onlooker naturally cues self-reflection and self-projection.
Many struggle with exposure to virtue signaling via social media and the way its recommendation algorithms create an expectation, foremost damning to the mental health of teenagers; giving rise to body dysmorphic disorder.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> [9]
When this reduces your scope of possible actions one could declare meaningful, because you feel that you can never miss your session, or can exclusively eat “clean”, then your fitness plays too big of a role—keeping everything in balance is imperative.
The most rational way to curb discontent, either way, is demystification and relativization of achievements, concluding in a simple cost–benefit analysis. Fulfillment depends on what you truly desire, as opposed to what you want to want.
Notwithstanding the above, as aging societies suffer from a lag of caregivers for elders, improving fitness to reduce care needs is made out as a core philosophy in geriatric nursing<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>; the pressure to become, or stay fit will only increase for all age groups.</p>

<h4 id="radical-ideas">Radical Ideas</h4>

<p>This is easier said than done, as even rational, scientifically minded practitioners rely on creating a grand narrative for temporarily improved performance and motivational purposes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have been thinking of food as an input output system for so long, I think, how can they do that with no purpose? The only way in this time in my life, that I can see myself, is an input output machine. Input nutrients, training, supplements, etc.; output objective, quantifiable performance and body composition measures. That’s it. That is the only thing that makes sense.”— Mike Israetel <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corine Pelluchon in her book “Les Nourritures: philosophie du corps politique”<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> specifies living as “living via [nutrition]”, unveiling a human’s fundamental dependency from food and the ethic responsibility towards the environment as its origin.
Under this premise, can purposeful eating in the above quoted manner be considered ethical?</p>

<p>Yukio Mishima, in his 1968 essay “Sun and Steel”,[1] supports this line of thinking with, as can be expected from him, radicality. He goes as far as to say, that imperfect “physical individuality”—necessarily also including improper nutrition—are narcissistic and an act of “shameless indecency”.
He further recognizes the applicability of what is labeled as “progressive overload” in modern exercise science for both classically ideal conceptualizations of exercise and education, setting forth the importance of balance between action(body) and word(thought); a corporeality of the subject.
His thought is only concerned about individualized well-being and a sense of superiority through physical supremacy.
While this opinion is regrettably prevalent in some circles, more often it is assumed by non-practitioners that everyone engaged in sport activities thinks in such ways.</p>

<h4 id="strength-sports-literature-review">Strength Sports Literature Review</h4>

<p>There is really no point in restating what has been said better hundreds of times before. I just want to highlight some a posteriori insights about resources regarding this topic, as the sheer amount of information available depresses the navigableness by a fair margin. Do not miss the forest for the trees.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You Are Your Own Gym: The Bible of Bodyweight Exercises - Joshua Clark &amp; Mark Lauren - 2011 [13]
    <ul>
      <li>You can get surprisingly far without a gym if you are a beginner; hypertrophic training in this manner is beneficial to strength training later on</li>
      <li>Invaluable during a pandemic or on holiday trips</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scientific Principles of Hypertrophy Training - Mike Israetel et al. [14]
    <ul>
      <li>The structure and style of writing in this book is in accordance to what you would want your hypertrophy training to look like; very comprehensible, no junk volume</li>
      <li>It is not an academic text, but I think it is a good starting point for science-based deepening of one’s knowledge</li>
      <li>The book “Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy” by Brad Schoenfeld is a more formal resource on hypertrophy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scientific Principles of Strength Training - Mike Israetel - 2015 [15]
    <ul>
      <li>The above applies, but the hypertrophy book feels more well-rounded</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Olympic Weightlifting - Greg Everett - 2008 [16]
    <ul>
      <li>Good book on weightlifting, but video is without a doubt a superior format for weightlifting movement demonstration</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>5/3/1 Forever - Jim Wendler - 2017 [17]
    <ul>
      <li>Jim Wendler, in his 5/3/1-book series, outlines programs based on nothing but his own anecdotal evidence. While I’m not fond of the author and his methodology, this book sets realistic expectations and specifies requirements concluding a well-rounded strength building program.</li>
      <li>This practical blueprint aligns with a surprising amount of scientific research conducted and detailed in some of the other books</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Power to the People - Pavel Tsatsouline - 1999 [18]
    <ul>
      <li>you are in a pandemic, sports equipment supply is running low and you only have a barbell and weights? This program is worth a try</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Glute Lab: The Art and Science of Strength and Physique Training - Bret Contreras [19]
    <ul>
      <li>Other books give a more structured approach and the main selling point of this one seems to be the glute focal point including the invention of the barbell hip thrust, which I personally do not find to be a good exercise, so I would not recommend the book</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Science and Practice of Strength Training - Vladimir M. Zatsiorsky et al. [20]
    <ul>
      <li>I particularity like the chapters on strength training for specific populations, good to know for advising referenced groups of people</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While people try to science their way out of hard work in training, they are inclined to go beyond scientific consensus in the fad prone field of nutrition in their quest for shortcuts, or mis/over-interpret findings and fall for micronutrient reductionism.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Muscle and Strength Training Pyramid: Nutrition - Eric Helms - 2018 [21]
    <ul>
      <li>A comprehensive, but thanks to its importance-sorted structure, applicable text with references for more detailed inquiries</li>
      <li>The author is part of the MASS (Monthly Applications in Strenght Sport) research review</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Essentials of Sports Nutrition and Supplements - Jose Antonio - 2008 [22]
    <ul>
      <li>Definitive textbook that may or may not be outdate in parts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Fatigue accumulated during exercise has to be recovered to ensure muscular adaptation to training load and is an integral part of the training process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stretching Anatomy - Arnold G. Nelson &amp; Jouko Kokkonen - 2006 [23]
    <ul>
      <li>The anatomy aspect of the book is more interesting than the stretching, because you get a feel for movement ranges and patterns via the illustrations</li>
      <li>I suppose more stretching can’t hurt and is advisable for most</li>
      <li>post-exercise static stretching can be a method to reduce perceived fatique</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why We Sleep - Matthew Walker - 2018 [24]
    <ul>
      <li>adequate sleep is the best recovery strategy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This may be tangentially related to strength sport, but consider preventive health screenings and stress management.
As a closing remark, remember that the pinnacle of non-professional sports is not to have your life revolve around it, but to incorporate sport successfully into your daily life to enhance it.</p>

      <p>Yukio Mishima was a Japanese writer and is considered controversial due to his nationalistic political activism, culminating in his seppuku after he and his militia stormed a military base, attempting to overthrow the obsequious post-war constitution.<br />
His autobiographical essay “Sun and Steel” portrays his reflections on martial arts and bodily conditions. It is quite short, but saying I didn’t understand everything he was trying to convey would be an understatement.

Even though Dostoevsky’s novella was published in 1864, more than 100 years before “Sun and Steel”, there is an interesting parallel regarding the over-reflective underground man, his hate for the morally inferior “men of action” and Mishima’s personal transformation away from his over-thinking consciousness, marked by what he would call nocturnal thought; It has been a while since I read both texts, so I am not sure how similar these concepts really are, but it would be interesting to have a conversation between those two regardless. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

<h4 id="the-value-of-painting">The Value of Painting</h4>

<p>Authentic Art opposes norms and introduces a transcendental perspective, a line of thought that could be taken to reveal the lag of value in the uniform output of the culture industry [Kulturindustrie].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Standardisierten und identischen Waren ausgeliefert, entwickeln die Konsumenten die vom System „gewünschten“ Bedürfnisse.” — [2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The capitalist dogma of profit maximization compels the industry to deliver addicting, hence instantaneously pleasurable products to the widest audience possible, rendering them docile as the desired is repeatedly exposed, mutilating one’s capacity to value and create non-standartized art.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Kulturindustrie sublimiert nicht sondern unterdrückt.” — [3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sublimation would indeed be difficult to achieve; qua establishment of a noise floor for the psychological drives, exposure to culture industrial goods should render ex nihilo creation of art impossible.
Through capitalism’s ability to accommodate various forms of resistance, opposition to the mainstream only validates the status quo, makes authentic art an accomplice chained to what it negates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sometimes doing nothing is the most violent thing to do” — [4], [5]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reproductions of master’s works can have meaning as a comment on the commodification of art itself, combining craftsmanship with the distinct minimization of personal artistic involvement by the artist.</p>

<p>Romanticized views attribute art the function of a deeper form of communication; a special form of expression by the painter. Painting can certainly behave like diary writing, the language used however is your very own, not to be taken verbatim, as all meaning and value is derived from the viewer’s perspective. Thus, a reproduction or copy of a painting can have the same perceived value as an authentic artwork, even if the value system from where it is judged is flawed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Painting is just another form of keeping a diary” — [6]</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="my-painting">My Painting</h4>

<p>With the distinctions made ex supra,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I am content with the fact, that this painting inheres a lower artistic value and meaning for me than some of my other paintings. Maybe take it as a comment on Kulturindustie, or something. This is probably also the reason I dislike sharing this work with others less, it just does not feel as personal/private as some others do.</p>

<p>The craftsmanship, with this painting only having $40\text{cm}\times30\text{cm}$ measurements and the degree of detail, proportions and reasonability of colors given, is pleasing. The paint layer is very thin and comprises of a acrylic underlayer based on the underdrawing, plotting out the different areas of similar scenery with a rough average color. Then introducing the full spectrum of detail in the second layer, and adjusting and highlighting further in the third. Factors that lead the uppermost paint layer to retain wet paint characteristics for longer, should increase in subsequent layers. This rule in mind, I increased the oil amount of the paint accordingly.</p>

<p>The biggest technical mistake I made with this painting, is not oiling out the jawline before reworking the area at one point. The strands of hair overlapping with the sky have a rugged texture; because I do not use any solvents as the core feature is quick dissipation making ventilation or respiratory mask use necessary, the paint’s plasticity is rather stiff. Only after varnishing did I notice, that the left eye highlight seems somewhat washed out and that the introduction of dust into the paint and varnish layer is minimal, but more than i would have liked.</p>

<p>Photographing the painting was a challenge in itself and I am still on the lookout for possible optimizations in the process. After varnishing the painting with Gamvar, every bit of impasto refracts and reflects the light. This image is the closest representation for now, it differs somewhat when seen tête-à-tête.</p>

From traditional instruments such as charcoal, to modern digital drawing software, the simple act of toning a surface with media to approximate the visual world is critical from visual arts, architecture, design, to engineering.</p>

<p>In distinction to painting, drawing involves dry media, with pastels bridging the gap towards the liquid media, like acrylic and oil paints. Drawing with its minimal equipment required to produce meaningful work, more so than painting, enables artistic expression within every milieu.</p>

<h4 id="detour-vertigo-1958">Detour: Vertigo (1958)</h4>

<p>Alfred Hitchcock, depicted in the accompaning drawing, is someone I first encountered by reading the books and listening to the taped versions of the popular juvenile detective book series “Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators” as a child, or rather their German translation.[1] Years later, my interest in film swiftly brought be back to the “Master of Suspense”. Hitchcock’s Vertigo is not only objectively one of the best movies, but <em>coincidentally</em> also one of my personal favourites.</p>

<p>Retired, acrophobic detective Scottie (James Stewart) is asked by Gavin Elster, an old friend, to follow his wife named Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), as she seems to strangely identify herself with Carlotta, a relative of hers who commited suicide. Scottie and Madeleine fall in love, but as she too commits suicide by jumping of a mission’s tower, Scottie gets depressed, descents into madness and tries to find Madeleine by frequenting places she has been to, noticing a woman named Judy. The viewer learns that this woman is “Madeleine” and was hired to act as Gavin’s wife to cover-up a murder, exploiting Scotties fear of heights. Scottie keeps wanting Judy to resemble Madeleine, but soon notices her necklace that is also shown on a painting of Carlotta, uncovering the scheme. He wants to drive her back to the alledged suicide scene, where he then finally overcomes his vertigo. As the two admit their love for each other, the story ends tragically as Judy falls to her death by accident.</p>

<p>This story leaves us with parallels between the characters; while at first glance, Scottie seems to be the victim of a murder cover-up scheme initiated by Gavin Elster and Judy, Scottie progressively becomes similar to Gavin, as he too objectifies Judy in order to realize his dream, oblivious to her infatuation for him. It would be easy to sympathize with Kim Novak’s Judy, as the sport of misfortune she is, tragically falling in love with a man who longs only for a woman that has never been real, then later falling to her own death; but didn’t she have it coming by tricking Scottie and taking money to cover up a crime?</p>

<p>Hitchcock’s female lead actors usually do not radiate this pleasant ambiguity, making Vertigo suspenseful by letting the viewer feel uncomfortable regardless of their own interpretation, or allegiance.</p>

<p>Now let’s get back to the point.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="drawing-of-alfred-hitchcock">Drawing of Alfred Hitchcock</h4>

<p>The reason for this motive is not that I like Vertigo so much, in reality I just wanted to draw an older man with wrinkles and many opportunities to introduce sharp detail in order to conveniently create a realistic look. While I value the craftsmanship aspects of drawing, I do not wish to lose all artistic interpretation.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the list above, I started to incorporate ink based products, mainly to achieve higher contrast. Most high-quality ink pens and markers are manufactured in Japan by brands—often with comic book artists in mind—like Sakura Color Products, Tombow, Uni Mitsubishi Pencil, Copic and Pentel, known for popularizing the Fudepen. This certainly improved my drawings, although it technically means that the “artworks” are a mixture of drawing and painting, if we take the definitions of the first paragraph as gospel.</p>

<p>In retrospect I should have toned the background in a light grey, that would improve the drawing immensely. To some extent I enjoy seeing mistakes, or wrong decisions in my drawings, because only then do I have a chance to improve.</p>

      <p>Let me just add that I read the 1954 french novel “The Living and the Dead” (original: “D’entre les morts”) by Boileau-Narcejacon the film is based on.[2] As it is set in France, a lot of the adaptation’s San Francisco atmosphere is missing and I imagine few would remember this book, if it was not for Hitchcock. I wouldn’t really recommend reading it. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
